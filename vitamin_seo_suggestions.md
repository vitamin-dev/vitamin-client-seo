## Why This, Why Now?

- It's unclear what is needed from an SEO vs Technical report
  - Are they different?
- How often per client? (Once a month, Once a quarter)?
- Is the person reporting the data suppose to hand it off 'client-ready'?
- Is anything needed that's not in the monthly auto-generated SEO Data Studio reports?
- Do we need to keep an excel file up to date with numbers that can easily be generated when needed?

## Things to consider
- A lot of people use ads blockers now.
  - Are there other services out there ad-blockers do not block?
- What do customers want to know?
  - Asking a marketing savy client like CX what's important to them might help us report better for other clients.
- What do these reports look like when they are sent to the client?
  - Are they text heavy? Would using visuals help? What does the client prefer?
- What's the difference between these monthly reports and the ones from Data Studio that are sent to team@
- Anything we could automate?
